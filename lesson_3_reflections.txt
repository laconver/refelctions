1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with other contributors or other remote sources. This helps keep everything in a centralized and accessible location.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may be working on some changes locally that you would lose if the remote version does not have them committed yet.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
